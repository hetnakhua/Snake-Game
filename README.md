# snake_game

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Snake game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around a board or screen, eating food and growing longer. The game becomes more challenging as the snake grows, and the player must avoid running into walls or the snake's own tail. The game can be played using arrow keys or swipe gestures on a touch screen.
